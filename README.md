#A Tour on Wind Forecasting Data

This repository is dedicated to perform analytics and some modelling on the Wind Energy Prediction Track of [Global Energy Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GEF2012-wind-forecasting), 2012.

In summary, you will see the followings in the `Energy_Forecasting`` jupyter notebook.

- Importing wind power generation dataset

- Importing forecast data for 7 wind farms

- Exploratory data analysis and visualization

- Cleaning and bringing data in correct format

- Time series feature engineering

- Modelling using K-NN regressor

- Modelling using K-NN regressor on scaled data

- Modelling using Random Forest on scaled data

The result shows that $50\%$ of the wind farm power data is explained using this model.
